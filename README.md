# Shift Pro Coding Material
This page contains all the material covered in the "Shift Pro Coding" course, as taught by me in 2024-2025.

The course consists of 30 lessons, and is divided into 2 parts. Each part includes 15 lessons:
- The first part covers Python fundementals using the Python interpreter and [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). Shell fundementals are also covered.
- The second part covers Arduino projects that teach basic electronic principles and the C programming language.


## Equipment
- The first part requires a computer with Python and Jupyter Notebooks installed.
- The first part requires a computer with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) installed, as well as:
  - Arduino UNO
  - USB-C to USB-A cable
  - Breadboard with jumper cables
  - Resistors of different values
  - LCDs
  - Potentiometers
  - Buzzer 5V
  - Photoresistor LDR 5mm
  - DS18B20 Temperature sensor
  - Waveshare LCD Module 16x2 
  - Ultrasonic sensor HY-SRF05
