# Arduino projects
This folder contains all projects covered in the 2nd section of the Shift Pro Coding course.

- `sos`: Blink the LED with an SOS signal.
- `potentiometer`: Use the potentiometer with an analog threshold.
- `buzzer`: Use the buzzer to produce sounds.
- `sos_buzzer`: Blink the LED with an SOS signal and produce a sound.
- `simple_button`: Sample program of how to create a button.
- `ambulance`: Flash 2 LEDs and produce sound.
- `nightlight`: Turn on the light when the light sensor detects low brightness.
- `lcd_scroll`: Produce a scrolling-text effect.
- `lcd_sample`: Sample program of how to initialize the LCD screen.
- `temperature_sensor`: Sample program of how to use the temperature sensor.
- `temperature_lcd`: Measure the temperature and show the output on the LCD screen.
- `lcd_counter`: Count how many times we have pressed a button and display it on the LCD screen.
- `ultrasonic`: Detect distance from ultrasonic sensor and show it on the serial monitor.
- `ultrasonic_LCD`: Detect distance from ultrasonic sensor and show it on the LCD screen.
- `ultrasonic_LCD_button`: Detect distance from ultrasonic sensor whenever the button is pressed, and show it on the LCD screen.
- `ultrasonic_LCD_button_buzzer`: Detect distance from ultrasonic sensor whenever the button is pressed, and show it on the LCD screen. Beep whenever the distance is below a threshold.
- `analog-slider`: Show a progress bar depending on how far we have turned the potentiometer knob. Turn the LED on above a certain threshold, tone the buzzer below it.
